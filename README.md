If you try to run php code on a regular computer as you are running your js, html and CSS IT WON'T WORK!!!!! the server has to support PHP in order to interpret the PHP code within the HTML tags.

After a long search on the web, I found the best way for testing is Wampsever as it supports almost everything you need to run and devolop web applications.

<h3> Pag4.php </h3>

In this file (client from Cruber), I have directed the data submited from the client to our MYSQL data base Using PHP as known for more security. Also, makes it easier to redirect to the next page with no issues.

(More updates to be coming)
